# Playing With Marvel API

This project is a web application built with React and TypeScript that mimics the look and feel of the [Marvel Characters](https://www.marvel.com/characters) page.
It fetches data from the Marvel API and allows users to navigate through a list of characters, to a character detail page
This project is designed to practice and display my accesible UI development skills and sensibility.
